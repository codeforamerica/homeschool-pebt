This is a standard Spring Boot application that uses the `form-flows` Java package as a library. It
can be customized to meet the needs of a web app, and is meant to be built upon. It's a plain,
boring (but modern) Spring app that uses common, frequently-used libraries throughout.

It contains example code for a simple, generic application for public benefits. An applicant
can fill out screens with their basic info, upload supporting documents, then submit it all.
Upon submission, they receive a simple SMS confirmation and a receipt email with a filled-in
application PDF. The entire experience is in both English and Spanish.

To power the form flow logic, this app depends on the `form-flows` Java library. That library is
included in `build.gradle` along with all other dependencies. The codebase for the `form-flows`
package is [open source](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow).

A detailed explanation of form flow concepts can be found on in
the [form flow library's readme](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow).

## Static Pages

Unlike Screens, Static Pages are HTML content and are not part of a flow. Detailed information
about static pages can be found in
the [form-flow library documentation.](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow#static-pages)

This application has three static pages served up by
the [StaticPageController](src/main/java/org/homeschoolpebt/app/StaticPageController.java)
class:

* [index.html](src/main/resources/templates/index.html)
* [faq.html](src/main/resources/templates/faq.html)
* [privacy.html](src/main/resources/templates/privacy.html)

## Example Actions and Conditions

Actions can be run at specific points in a form submission's life cycle.

### Actions

There are for types of actions that one can use.

* `beforeSaveAction`
* `onPostAction`
* `crossFieldValidationAction`
* `beforeDisplayAction`

You can find more detailed information about each type of action in the Form Flow library's
[readme](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow#actions).

#### ClearIncomeAmountsBeforeSaving

This action is a `beforeSaveAction` and is run after validation but before the data is
stored in the database.
The `UpdateIncomeAmountsBeforeSaving` will clear out any unused Income types, if they were
updated. For example, a user fills out the income type page and submits values for their chosen
input types. If they then decide to go back and change a value or add a new income type, this action
will ensure that any previous values entered that the user then cleared out are cleared out in the
stored data as well.

#### UpdatePersonalInfoDates

This is an `onPostAction` and is run just after the data is sent to the server, before any
validation is done on it. The `UpdatePersonalInfoDates` action will do the following for both
the `birth` and `movedToUSA` fields on the `Personal Info` page. It will take the three separate
date fields associated with them (day, month, and year) and put an aggregated date string into a
general date field (`birthDate` and `movedToUSADate`, respectively).

#### ValidateMovedToUSADate

This is a `crossFieldValidationAction` and is run just after field level validation has occurred,
but before the data is stored in the database.  `ValidateMovedToUSADate` will check to see if the
client has indicated that they moved to the USA in the last year. If they have, then this action
will check to see that they've entered values for `movedToUSA` day, month and year, as well as check
to see that the resulting date is actually valid.

### Conditions

# Setup instructions

## System dependencies

_Note: these instructions are specific to macOS, but the same dependencies do need to be installed
on Windows as well._

### Java Development Kit

If you do not already have Java 17 installed, we recommend doing this:

```
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
brew install --cask temurin17
```

### Set up jenv to manage your jdk versions

First run `brew install jenv`.

Add the following to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(jenv init -)"
```

For m1 macs, if the above snippet doesn't work, try:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"
export JENV_ROOT="/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jenv/"
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
eval "$(jenv init -)"
```

Reload your terminal, then finally run this from the repo's root directory:

```
jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```

### Gradle

`brew install gradle`

### Start the local databases

- Install PostgreSQL 14 via an [official download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
    - Or on macOS, through homebrew: `brew install postgresql@14`

- Create two databases using the command line:
    - Local instance:
      - `$ createdb starter-app`
      - `$ createuser -s starter-app`
    - Tests:
      - `$ createdb starter-app-test`
      - `$ createuser -s starter-app-test`

### Setup Environment

Note that you'll need to provide some environment variables specified in [sample.env](sample.env) to
your IDE/shell to run the application. We use IntelliJ and have provided setup instructions for
convenience.

#### IntelliJ

- `cp sample.env .env` (.env is marked as ignored by git)
- Download the [EnvFile plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile) and follow the
  setup instructions[here](https://github.com/Ashald/EnvFile#usage) to setup Run Configurations with
  EnvFile.

### Setup Application

- Use instructions from
  the [form-flow library here.](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow#intellij-setup)
- Run the application using the `StarterApplication` configuration (found
  in `org.homeschoolpebt.app`)

### Contributing Live Templates to your App

If you have created live templates with fragments which are specific to your application based on a
starter app template, you can commit them to your repository. You will follow a similar pattern to
create templates to what is outlined
[in the form-flow library here.](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow#contribute-new-live-templates)

An example template which was set up using this process, starting from an html snippet is available
[in this repository's IntelliJ settings folder](intellij-settings/StarterAppLiveTemplate.xml).

### Using a local version of the Form-Flow Library (For Form-Flow Library Developers)

To use a local version of the  [form-flow](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow) library you
can do the following:

1. Clone the `form-flow` repo in the same directory as the starter app.
2. Build the `form-flow` library jar.
3. In this app, set the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE`  to `dev` in
   the [`.env`](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow-starter-app/blob/main/sample.env) file.
4. Start the `form-flow-starter-app`.

Changing the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` to `dev` will cause the starter
app's [build.gradle](build.gradle) to pull in the local library, via this line:

 ```
 implementation fileTree(dir: "$rootDir/../form-flow/lib/build/libs", include: '*.jar')
 ```

# Using this as a template repository

## AWS Setup

1. Provision a new AWS bucket.
    1. We use two buckets: one for demo purposes and another for production.
2. Replace the bucket names with your newly created buckets in
   the [main application configuration](src/main/resources/application.yaml) and
   the [demo application configuration](src/main/resources/application-demo.yaml).

## Cloud deployment

### Aptible Setup

For [Aptible](https://www.aptible.com/) configuration information, please see
their [documentation](https://deploy-docs.aptible.com/).

The [Aptible CLI documentation](https://deploy-docs.aptible.com/docs/cli) is particularly helpful.

Here are the general steps to setup a new application in Aptible:

1. Create a new environment and application in Aptible, or create a new application in an existing
   environment.
2. Setup Aptible permissions to enable deploying your application, if they do not already exist.
3. Provision a database for your application in Aptible.
4. Add repository secrets for the deploy github action.

## Development Setup

1. Create a
   [new repository from the `form-flow-starter-app` template](https://github.com/codeforamerica/form-flow-starter-app/generate)
   .
2. Once the repository is created, clone it on your local machine.
3. Create a new database and user for your project. Please use descriptive names which are unique to
   your project to avoid conflicts locally.
   For example, for `childcare-illinois-model-app` we used `childcare-illinois` for both the
   database name and username. Following this example, create the new database and user with the
   following commands:

- `$ createdb childcare-illinois`
- `$ createuser -s childcare-illinois`. This assumes that you have installed postgres locally, if
  that is not the case please refer back to [this section](#start-the-local-databases).

4. Edit the [main application configuration](src/main/resources/application.yaml) as well as
   the [demo application configuration](src/main/resources/application-demo.yaml) to reflect your
   new database configuration. Replace the database name and username with the ones you created in
   the last step in the datasources section of the document.
   For example, the datasource section of your application configuration would initially contain the
   details for the `starter-app` database as follows:

```yaml 

datasource:
   url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/starter-app
   username: starter-app
```

and should be updated to this

```yaml 

datasource:
   url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/childcare-illinois
   username: childcare-illinois
```

5. To load the `.env` file in IntelliJ, you'll need to enable
   the [EnvFile Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile). Then enable it for your
   project.
