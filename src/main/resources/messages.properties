faq.am-i-eligible.title=Am I eligible for the Universal Basic Income (UBI) Pilot?
faq.am-i-eligible.content.p1=US residents who meet all of the following eligibility requirements are eligible to participate:

faq.am-i-eligible.content.li6=For a family of 2: $45,775
faq.am-i-eligible.content.li7=For a family of 3: $57,575
